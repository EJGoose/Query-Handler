# Query Handler
-----------
## Project Description
This simple project is a script that retrieves query parameters from URLs using the $_GET super global and then displays the name and value of each parameter. The script can also handle cases where some values are missing and does basic input sanitisation for security. The script contains a form to allow the user to submit their own data, additionally it contains a variety of sample URLs to test different functions. 

### This Project Primarily Explores
- Retrieiving query parameters from a URL using the $_GET super global.
- Displaying those values back to the user
- Handling unexpected or missing data
- Basic input controls

### Notes
- To run this file locally you will require a local server, during development I used XAMPP to run an Apache server.
